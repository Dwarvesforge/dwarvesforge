# Who are Dwarvesforge?

The only requirement to be part of Dwarvesforge is to love coffee ☕️ and dwarves 🤘. If you know how to develop in php, python, nodejs, etc... it's good as well.

More seriously, we are a young collectve of creative developers with a goal in mind. Build tools to make every team working day life better.
This is our first and only concern. All our tools are build around that purpose.

## Why?

Dwarvesforge has been started by **employees working in the same agency**. To work together efficiently, we have though about how to structure and optimize our workflow and how to build upon our work instead of building the wheel again and again.
Here's some key points why we have started this organisation:

1. Centralize our generic code like helpers, classes, etc... to avoid spreading it everywhere
2. Embrace the open source philosophy
3. Be sure that our code is well documented

## Our tools

Here's the list of tools we have for now in order to achieve our primary focus:

> Working together as smoothly as possible

- **[Thorin](https://github.com/Dwarvesforge/thorin)** : Pretty cool PHP toolkit that gives you access to a nice collection of functions/classes/helpers.
- [And many more to discover/come...](https://github.com/Dwarvesforge)
