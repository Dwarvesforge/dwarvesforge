# Welcome to the Dwarvesforge organization

We are a young collectve of creative developers with one goal in mind. **Build tools to make every team working day life better. This is our first and only concern.** All our tools are build around that purpose.
All what we provide are some cool tools that you can use the way you want.

## Our tools

- **[Thorin](https://github.com/Dwarvesforge/thorin)** : Pretty cool PHP toolkit that gives you access to a nice collection of functions/classes/helpers.
- [And many more to discover...](https://github.com/Dwarvesforge)

## Open source is our roadmap

We strongly believe that the way to success is by helping each others. That’s why our primary target for our tools is to be published as fully open source projects that you can (and we hope you will) modify, enhance and share!
